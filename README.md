# Quick Revise – Notebook Style Flashcard Web App

**Quick Revise** is a pastel-themed full-stack web app that helps students quickly revise topics before exams using interactive flashcards.  
It’s built with **React + Vite** (frontend) and **Supabase** (backend database).  

✨ The UI is inspired by real spiral notebooks — cute, girly-pop colors (rose, lavender, aqua) with animated note cards.
